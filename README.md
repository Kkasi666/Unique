# Unique Instruction

## Information
	A programming language is prepared for SourceSpace Studio coding.

## How To Install?
### 0. By default, I think you are in the `Unique` directory and your computer have `Make`(or `mingw32-make`).
### 1. Make Unique compiler and Unique VM.
1. Use `make` or `mingw32-make` to make file.
2. The compiler is in `./UCM/build/` and called `quec`,
   the VM is in `.UVM/build/` and called `que`.
3. I advise seting environment variable then use `quec (proName)` to run compiler
   and use `que (proByteCodeName)` to run VM.

### 2. Try Compiler a unique code.
1. There is a unique code file is called `pro1.que` in `./testbench/test1`.
2. `quec ./testbench/test1/pro1.1ue` to compile.
3. `que pro1` to execute unique byte code.
